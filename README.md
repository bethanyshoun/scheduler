# Work Day Scheduler

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to create a daily planner application that has time blocks for standard business hours. Each tiem block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Events added are saved in local storage and persist when the page is refreshed. 

The project challenged me early on because I was not attentive to pre-made class and id names in the starer code. Once I realized my error in duplicating or recreating those class and id names, it was very simple to refactor my code. 

The greatest challenge in finishing the project came with getting local storage to set and get items appropriately. Using google searches and comparing other students' shared examples with my own code and W3 Schools/Free Code Camp documentation, I was able to complete the task.

Upon a google search for help with the color coding, found severl earlier students' repositories. This particular repository was what I compared with my code to help me clean up my functionality and class/id names https://github.com/sylviaprabudy/work-day-scheduler
