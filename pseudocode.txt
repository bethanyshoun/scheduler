Pseudo Code for Work Day Scheduler
Task:
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

How it functions:
1. Planner opened (this is main page with header)
2. Current Day Displayed at Top of Calendar
    $("#currentDay") //grabbing the id
    $("#currentDay").text(Here put value for current day)
    *Use Moment Library to get Day, Month, Date
    Method- format

3. Time Blocks for standard business hours
    -Add Time blocks in html

4. Color Code time blocks to indicate past, present, future with three different colors

5. Click on time block
    -Add event listener "click" to each block *Can this be done with one function?
    -Enter an event in the time block

6. Click save button for each time block   
    -Create save button /lock or other icon on side
    -Save in localStorage

7. Create localStorage 

8. Events persist when page is refreshed (see taskinator for help with this)

*Writing what you will do at each step
Example: for loop will start (var i) . . . 
- what types of loops, functions, parameters, returns, etc.

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
